# nations-api-django-project
Decided to create a very basic API with Django on the various countries and ethnicity. It doesn't show population, nation income, etc. This API was creating purely for learning purposes only.
At the present moment creating basic API's with Django for learning and to better gain a deeper understanding on how the framework is used in order to create my own API projects.
